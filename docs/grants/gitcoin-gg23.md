> An onchain embodiment of your (financial) data, in the form of a pet monkey

**What if your spending habits had a face — and a liver?**

Dash Mon[k]ey is an onchain tamagotchi that embodies your financial health. Inspired by behavioral science and the 90s craze of virtual pets, this project externalizes your “monkey brain” to help you visualize your habits and correct them—before it’s too late.

If your card statements show excessive clubbing, your monkey gets liver damage. Too much food delivery? Upset stomach. But a diet rich in leafy greens? Glowing fur and clear skin.

Your monkey is you—just five steps further down the path you’re on.

By feeding it healthy recipes (habits), you improve both your life and your monkey’s fate. And because everything is onchain, your progress is visible, social, and collectible.

## Core Features

### Expense Tracking

Track every cent through receipt uploads, bank statements, and more—parsed locally via Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The structured data powers your monkey’s health and personalized dashboard visualizations. A mobile app makes it frictionless to snap and submit receipts.

As a bonus, we’re exploring decentralized OCR via federated learning. Users train a local model on their devices and submit updated weights for rewards. If successful, this could pioneer decentralized, privacy-first AI.

### Recipe Marketplace

Inspired by copy trading, users can mint financial strategies as NFTs — automating everything from DCA to transfer 10% of income to savings. Your funds never leave your wallet until trade execution, reducing trust risks. Over time, healthy financial behavior unlocks access to rarer, more powerful recipes. Financial literacy becomes a game.

### Health is Wealth

Once active, users can choose to link health data (e.g., steps, HR, sleep) for deeper insights. With demographics and spending, we can map real-world health outcomes to lifestyle choices—fully anonymized, locally processed, and optionally shared. The monkey was chosen precisely for its biological proximity to humans, making it the perfect proxy for experimentation.


### Privacy by Design

- All data is local-first
- Encrypted before going onchain
- Only high-level insights or state changes (e.g., liver damage) are public

We rely on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and ZK proofs where needed. We believe this is the only ethical way to handle health and financial data.

# Project Timeline

**2021** Project first conceptualized, following the announcement of the Account Aggregator network on the [IndiaStack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Stack).

**2023** Small projects built around independent features to gauge interest.

**2025 Q1** Work on MVP begins in earnest, with the idea presented multiple times over the ethDenver and ethSF.

***2025 Q2*** Alpha release.

# Resources

Up to date information can be found on the [community github repository](https://github.com/sliver-labs/dash-monkey). Since the project has been in ideation for a long time, and iterated upon several times, the repositories and other related material for the project is very spread out. As such, most current information will be available in the repository linked above, and will contain links to other repositories, along with docs, and community discussions.

# How will funds be used

Finally, any funding received as a result of this grant will go towards the following (in order),
- Developer support, ensuring a full-time focus on the project
- Deployment of beta version on mainnet 
- Security audits of the contracts and rollup infra
- Sponsoring user transactions until the project becomes self-sustaining
